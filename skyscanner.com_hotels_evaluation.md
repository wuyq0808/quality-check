## Evaluation Results

## Evaluation Results

| Feature | Skyscanner Hotels |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Main City Destination Priority** | 7/7 – Excellent: Perfect performance with Paris, London, Tokyo, New York, and Barcelona all appearing as the first result when typed correctly |
| **Relevant POI Display** | 6/7 – Very Good: Shows highly relevant landmarks and attractions (Eiffel Tower, Central Park, Sagrada Familia, etc.) alongside the main city results, providing useful context for travelers |
| **Language Consistency** | 6/7 – Very Good: All POIs are consistently displayed in English/romanized form regardless of the original city, maintaining interface consistency and usability for English-speaking users |
| **Typo Tolerance** | 4/7 – Neutral: Mixed performance - handles some common typos well ("Londn"→London, "Tokio"→Tokyo) but fails with others ("Pariz" doesn't suggest Paris, "Berln" doesn't suggest Berlin, "Brelin" doesn't suggest Berlin) |

### Summary

**Standout Strengths:**
- **Excellent city prioritization**: Main cities consistently appear as the first result with perfect accuracy
- **Rich contextual information**: POIs, airports, districts, and hotels provide comprehensive options for each destination
- **Clean, consistent presentation**: All results maintain consistent formatting and language, making the interface intuitive
- **Comprehensive result diversity**: Shows cities, airports, hotels, districts, and attractions in a well-organized hierarchy

**Drawbacks:**
- **Inconsistent typo handling**: While some common typos and alternative spellings work well (Tokio→Tokyo), others fail completely (Pariz for Paris, Berln for Berlin)
- **Limited fuzzy matching**: The autocomplete seems to rely more on exact character matching rather than sophisticated fuzzy search algorithms
- **No "did you mean" suggestions**: When typos aren't recognized, there's no fallback to suggest the intended destination

The autocomplete feature performs excellently for accurate typing and provides valuable contextual information, but could benefit from more robust typo tolerance and fuzzy matching capabilities.
