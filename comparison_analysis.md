## Comparison Results

| Test   | Skyscanner | Booking.com |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Main City Destination Priority** | 7/7 – Excellent: Perfect performance with Paris, London, Tokyo, New York, and Barcelona all appearing as the first result when typed correctly | 7/7 – Excellent: The main city destination consistently appears as the first result across all tested cities (New York, Paris, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Barcelona, Rome) |
| **Relevant POI Display** | 6/7 – Very Good: Shows highly relevant landmarks and attractions (Eiffel Tower, Central Park, Sagrada Familia, etc.) alongside the main city results, providing useful context for travelers | 6/7 – Very Good: Shows highly relevant Points of Interest including city centers, major landmarks (Eiffel Tower, Times Square), airports, and popular areas (Shinjuku, Gothic Quarter) |
| **Language Consistency** | 6/7 – Very Good: All POIs are consistently displayed in English/romanized form regardless of the original city, maintaining interface consistency and usability for English-speaking users | 6/7 – Very Good: All POI names are displayed in English for international consistency, even for non-English speaking destinations like Tokyo and Barcelona |
| **Typo Tolerance** | 4/7 – Neutral: Mixed performance - handles some common typos well ("Londn"→London, "Tokio"→Tokyo) but fails with others ("Pariz" doesn't suggest Paris, "Berln" doesn't suggest Berlin, "Brelin" doesn't suggest Berlin) | 5/7 – Good: Successfully handles simple typos like "Londno→London" and "Berln→Berlin", but struggles with more severe typos like "Rme" (doesn't suggest Rome). Requires at least 3 characters to work effectively |

### Summary

- **Skyscanner**  
  - **Standout strengths:** Excellent city prioritization with perfect accuracy, rich contextual information including diverse result types (POIs, airports, districts, hotels), clean and consistent presentation across all destinations
  - **Drawbacks:** Inconsistent typo handling with complete failures on some common misspellings, limited fuzzy matching capabilities, no "did you mean" suggestions for unrecognized typos

- **Booking.com**  
  - **Standout strengths:** Perfect city prioritization across comprehensive testing, fast response time with instant autocomplete, effective duplicate result handling, comprehensive POI coverage including neighborhoods and landmarks
  - **Drawbacks:** Limited tolerance for severe spelling errors, lacks phonetic matching capabilities, requires minimum 3-character input, missing explicit typo correction functionality

**Overall:** Both platforms excel at core functionality with identical scores for city prioritization, POI display, and language consistency. Booking.com demonstrates slightly better typo handling, making it marginally more user-friendly for users who make spelling errors.
