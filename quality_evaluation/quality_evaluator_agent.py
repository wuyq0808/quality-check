1. Intent Alignment Check: Verify that the top listings align with user intent (e.g. centrally located, well-reviewed, reasonably priced options appear first).
2. Review Score Relevance Check: Confirm that top listings include hotels with strong guest scores unless filters or sorting override it.
3. Star Rating vs Price Balance Check: Ensure that the first few listings represent a healthy mix of quality (e.g. 3‚Äì5 star) and value, rather than skewing too heavily toward one end.
4. Repeat Search Consistency Check: Repeat the same search multiple times and check if the top listings remain consistent unless availability changes. (REFRESH THE PAGE AND SEARCH AGAIN TO MAKE SURE IT IS RENEWED)
5. Local Context Appropriateness Check: For destination-specific searches (e.g. Tokyo city center), verify that top listings are contextually appropriate (e.g. located in Shinjuku rather than suburban outskirts).
