## Evaluation Results

Based on my comprehensive testing of Booking.com's auto-complete feature for hotel destinations, here's my detailed evaluation:

| Feature   | Booking.com | 
|-----------|-------------|
| Main City Destination Priority | 7/7 – Excellent: The main city destination consistently appears as the first result across all tested cities (New York, Paris, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Barcelona, Rome) |
| Relevant POI Display | 6/7 – Very Good: Shows highly relevant Points of Interest including city centers, major landmarks (Eiffel Tower, Times Square), airports, and popular areas (Shinjuku, Gothic Quarter) |
| Language Consistency | 6/7 – Very Good: All POI names are displayed in English for international consistency, even for non-English speaking destinations like Tokyo and Barcelona |
| Typo Handling | 5/7 – Good: Successfully handles simple typos like "Londno→London" and "Berln→Berlin", but struggles with more severe typos like "Rme" (doesn't suggest Rome). Requires at least 3 characters to work effectively |

### Summary

**Standout Strengths:**
- **Perfect city prioritization**: Main city destinations always appear first, providing users with the most logical choice
- **Rich POI suggestions**: Comprehensive inclusion of airports, city centers, landmarks, and popular neighborhoods
- **Consistent language approach**: All suggestions displayed in English for global usability
- **Fast response time**: Autocomplete appears instantly with minimal lag
- **Duplicate result handling**: Shows both main destinations and sub-areas appropriately

**Drawbacks:**
- **Limited typo tolerance**: Fails to correct more severe spelling errors that deviate significantly from the original word
- **No phonetic matching**: Doesn't handle typos based on phonetic similarity
- **Minimum character requirement**: Needs at least 3 characters for meaningful suggestions
- **No "Did you mean?" functionality**: Missing explicit typo correction suggestions that other platforms offer

The autocomplete feature performs excellently for standard use cases and provides a highly polished user experience with comprehensive destination coverage and logical result prioritization.
